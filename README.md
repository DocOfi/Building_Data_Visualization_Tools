# My Data Visualization Projects 

I just finished the awesome course Building Data Visualization Tools in Coursera. 

The course is taught by:    

- Roger D. Peng, PhD, Associate Professor Biostatistics 
     - Bloomberg School of Public Health
- Brooke Anderson,  Assistant Professor Environmental & Radiological Health Sciences
     - Colorado State University from Johns Hopkins University

I decided to create projects that will involve data from my country the Philippines and share them with everyone by placing them in this repository.
